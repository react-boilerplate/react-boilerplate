ElectronJS is very popular open source library developed by github to create cross platform desktop application using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This article explains some steps through which you can kick start your electron application using this boilerplate. As you have come here to build a desktop applilcation, I assume that you are a little bit familier with electron. Electron provides a combined single runtime of chromium and node.js where you don't require a server anymore to host your react application. We can simply package the entire source code in an exe, dmg or deb file.
